# iEnhancer-GDM
Enhancers are short sequences of DNA that increase the frequency of gene transcription significantly, and often act on targeted genes over long distances, either in cis or trans. The identification of enhancers is challenging because of their variable position and sensitivity. In addition, genetic variants of enhancers have been shown to be associated with human diseases, so identifying enhancers and their strength is of great biological importance. In this study, we developed a two-layer predictor (called iEnhancer-GDM) to identify enhancers and their strength. In order to solve the problem of model overfitting and low classification accuracy caused by relatively small training dataset, WGAN-GP was introduced to expand the dataset. The model uses dna2vec to transform the original DNA sequence into digital vectors, and then uses multi-scale convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory network and multi-head attention mechanism for feature extraction and classification. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WGAN-GP for dataset augmentation. The evaluation results of independent test datasets show that iEnhancer-GDM significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models. We believe that this method shows the potential power of deep learning in bioinformatics sequences and helps accelerate genetic studies of enhancers and their strength.
